<p class="paragraph">Imagine with me the summer of 1989 in Wyoming. You have a job as a fire lookout. You're walking through the woods and enjoying the scenery when suddenly you hear a speaker crackling. It's your walkie-talkie buzzing with the voice of your supervisor, Delilah, as she wants to talk. And you have the choice to either ignore her or respond and risk having to explain your wife's dementia for the fifth or sixth time.</p>

<p>Made by San Francisco-based Campo Santo, Firewatch came along last February with a twenty dollar price tag and made few promises. Which is why I think it went under many people's radar despite showing qualities of games with price tags tree times its own.</p>

<p>Let's start with the obvious: The visuals. They are stunning. From the skybox to the almost cartoonish forest to the turtle, almost every visual element has been thought out and reworked to perfection. That's not to say everything kneels before gameplay—the Californian company understands that other videogame elements like the story or visual narrative are important as well, so they bend elements to the best of their abilities to try and fit them together. The books in the watch tower don't serve a gameplay purpose, just like a fallen log doesn't help the story; The former expands the story by providing visual clues that tell you about Henry, the character you're playing as, while the latter has been delicately placed in the game's world to create an ambiance that fits both the story as well as the world the game is building. And boy does Firewatch build up its world.</p>

<p>As if the visuals weren't convincing enough, the voice acting—half of it conveyed through the crackling walkie-talkie as Delilah—is without a doubt professional. With perfect timing, pitch, and tempo, the two voice actors manage to convince you without a hitch that you're indeed lost in Wyoming's lush forests, helping the story to progress right along with Henry and Delilah. You're exploring the forest with little more than a vague map and a compass to your name, no minimap or quest markers, which is a great way to both branch out from big modern titles as well as to support the illusion that you really are wandering through Wyoming.</p>

<p>But once we connect all these dots, all that's left is the story, which felt to me during my playthrough like it was the game’s largest weakpoint. Multiple story lines happen at the same time from the second you take your first steps into the wilderness until the very end of the game: You'll see abandoned skis leaning on a tree and the game will dismiss them, but you'll get to read several letters that two unknown rangers had left for each other in the woods over the years. It's weird to see that something this trivial is being overlooked and an additional tale being told over the already heavy plot, especially after having seen how perfectly tuned the gameplay mechanics and visual elements are to the game's style and world.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe with Firewatch is its ending. It brings two plot lines to a very solid close, but it not only leaves questions open, it goes so far as to ask new ones as well—and these questions are not ones you can answer by yourself by drawing concrete conclusions from past events. Instead, you have to guess. Guess what happens to Delilah, what happens to her relationship with Henry, and what happens with Henry’s wife. Is the mysterious man who had been the source of tension the entire game ever caught? In a way, this makes the game feel unfinished, rushed out the company door like an unwanted guest. But then you realize this isn’t a big studio with a big budget—They don’t have to conform to standards and end the game on a predictable note. The game’s nature allows them to leave a lot of the interpretation up to the player. This includes the story’s end, as well as things I would call ‘trivial to overlook’ while I was playing, like the skis I mentioned earlier. Because aside from the very core plot of the game, the player is free to uncover or imagine anything they would like about what is being suggested, either visually or verbally, going from how there are skis in a forest in the middle of the summer to people who worked in your outpost in the years before Henry came along.</p>

<p>Firewatch isn't a long or expensive game. It's a lot like summer; it’s enjoyable all the way through but once it's over you can't help but wish for a bit more, and I think this was fully intended. It's short and everything it sets out to do, it does as it should, which, if you’re anything like me, includes frustrating the player, and that's exactly why I think it's a great game. If you're looking for a relaxing and polished game that steers away from modern blockbusters then it's a must-play.</p>
