<p class="paragraph">You're playing a good old Assassin's Creed game, climbing along the rooftops of late 15th century Venice, fighting Italian soldiers and riding your horse, when suddenly you realize that something is off. Instead of Venice, it's Mordor, straight from Tolkien's books, Italian men are replaced with Orcs, and your horse is actually a monstrous giant. Oh, and the game is actually <i>fun</i>.</p>

<p>Adding new lore to an already-existing universe is a surefire way to gain notoriety; George Lucas demonstrated the idea in what by releasing now known as the Star Wars prequels. Thankfully, fans of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> universe only accept Tolkien's original writings as canon, meaning works such as Monolith's <i>Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor</i>'s storyline largely go unnoticed by the fanbase. For the most part, this has allowed Monolith's creation to be enjoyed by many, regardless of the fact that the game often goes against what Tolkien has written. That said, we should accept, going forward, that <i>Shadow of Mordor</i> is not aimed towards hardcore fans of The Lord of the Rings, but instead casual gamers who enjoy the medium and can appreciate Tolkien's work.</p>

<p>The problem, I think, is that <i>Shadow of Mordor</i> can't deviate far from LoTR canon because it really doesn't offer much in the sense of a story. It's a bit cliché, really—Orcs storm your outpost and kill you and your family, you get resurrected and your spirit is joined with the ghost of a powerful elf. The two of you join forces to get revenge on the one who brought you back into the world of the living, yadda yadda. But this shallow story just works in this game, and that might just be because of the gameplay that largely distracts the player from the storyline.</p>

<p>So then, let's focus on the gameplay. If you've played any of Ubisoft's <i>Assassin's Creed</i> installments, then you know, for the most part, how <i>Shadow of Mordor</i> is played. Except this one is better. It feels like Monolith had been looking over Ubisoft's shoulders, then mixed together the good parts along with some fixes, and some of their own elements. It all beautifully blends to see you play as a man fighting with a sword who doesn't have to wait for his enemies to attack before he can counter them, who can climb buildings and <i>doesn't</i> randomly leap to his death, uses a <i>satisfying</i> ranged weapon, and can ride giant two- and four-legged beasts. It's not a gameplay experience suit for a 'Gameplay Hall of Fame', but it's so much better than what we're used to from these kinds of games that it casts a giant shadow (of Mordor) over past releases such as <i>Assassin's Creed</i>, the game that kickstarted the genre. It's also worth noting that the game is incredibly well optimized for running on different PC configurations—during my time with it, the framerate never dipped enough to be unplayable on my old mid-range computer, which is a surprise considering all the eyecandy the game throws at the player.</p>

<p>That's not to say that SoM isn't without its own faults. While the combat, for example, feels very smooth and flows well, you can get away with only using two buttons. It feels satisfying to see at first, but after downing the hundredth or so Orc it becomes dull. It's easy to spice it up if you have some imagination, but it shouldn't be up to the player to figure out how to make a big part of the game interesting. And, like in any open-world game, the world map is big, making it bland by extension—Unlike in a small game world as, for example, in <a href="http://someone755.github.io/content/20170426" class="paragraphLinks"><i>Firewatch</i></a>, where each tree and corridor are placed to serve a purpose, open-world games lack this attention to detail. Instead, <i>Shadow of Mordor</i> has to resort to using the same building models over and over again. And sometimes it can seem like missions are separated by hours of walking, though that time is easily filled by completing mini-missions and finding Orcs to slaughter on the way.</p>

<p>Speaking of Orcs, a lot of emphasis is put onto what Monolith calls 'the Nemesis system', a sort of AI that aims to shuffle up how you fight with Orc leaders. Supposedly, every one of them is randomly generated, both in terms of visual features as well as fighting characteristics; Some will flee in the presence of bees, and some will become harder to fight against, that sort of thing. They also remember previous encounters, including your previous deaths, making their taunts unique every time you approach them. 'Nemesis' isn't a selling point on its own, but it fulfills its purpose and makes combat encounters more than just a routine.</p>

<p>And that's really what it all comes down to: in the ocean of mediocre and repetitive titles, <i>Shadow of Mordor</i> is more than just a routine. It's an adventure that does enough things right that it's still enjoyable if you're ready to put a small bit of effort and imagination into it. It's far from the best game, but it's well worth your time so long as you treat it less like your personal butler and more like a child.</p>

<p>Lettuce Play is an ongoing series of reviews-slash-opinions that are late to the party. And that's okay, because neither enjoyment nor its analysis should be rushed out for the sake of driving more traffic to your website.</p>
