<p class="paragraph">Do you ever feel nauseous? Stressed and impatient due to life's difficulties? Did Demons from Hell invade your workplace again this weekend? Then grab your shotgun and get ready to bathe in the guts of the hellish creatures – or near enough, anyway – as we explore <i>DOOM</i>, Bethesda's 2016 masterpiece.</p>
<div class="articleSeparator"></div>

<p>Originally a 1993 title, the first <i>DOOM</i> game has since been ported to just about every platform: From Texas Instruments calculators to the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar, the game is a true staple of both videogame as well as computer science history. But somebody one day decided that, after more than twenty long years, the franchise would benefit from a reboot. And how right they were.</p>

<p>Upon launching the game, you notice a few things. First is the head-banging soundtrack. Harsh, manly, rude, full of testosterone. If this fails to pump you up for what's coming then you may well close the game right now. But you're not some five-year-old girl, you're a man! At this point you're foaming at your mouth, and your muscles have swollen so much they've ripped your shirt apart. You're ready to step into the game, where immediately you get to beat the ever-living shit out of some sissy demons.</p>

<p>Ahem. Alright, back to the review. You'll notice this game instills in the player a very strong emotion. Not anger or hate or Satan-worship, as the numerous pentagrams throughout the game and its loading screens and menus might have you believe. Instead, it's a feeling of empowerment, an almost maddening one, as the in-game character, "Doomguy" (or, as he is referred to officially, "Doom Slayer", though this doesn't have the same 90s vibe), is armed to the teeth with a chain gun, a shotgun with explosive projectiles, self-guided rocket-launcher, and numerous other ranged weapons, yet still there is the option of ripping otherworldly beasts apart with your bare hands, or with a chainsaw, if you so please. And being covered in monster blood has never been so very enticing! The soundtrack and gameplay really do work well together to give unrestrained freedom to the player's whims, and this is further supported by the level design.</p>

<p>Vertical movement, scattered power-ups, jump pads, portals, it's almost like being transported back to the golden age of the first person shooter arena. You have the option of charging headfirst into the fray, or strategically picking apart the hordes of beasts that are coming your way by using jumps and corridors to your advantage. Once or twice I found myself lost, as some map markers are placed in awkward locations, but on the other hand I got to experience more of the environment, and found a few secrets because of it. That's not necessarily a sign of a bad level layout, but rather – or so I choose to believe – a sign of gamers' sense of game exploration withering due to increasingly linear level designs in modern videogames. Make no mistake: <i>DOOM</i>'s level design is outstanding, and fits the game's tone (and the thrashing metal music) perfectly.</p>

<p>Of course, with all this mayhem, it's foolish to expect there to be a storyline, but that's not to say that id Software, the game's developers, didn't try. It's banal, but the plot and pacing could honestly have been pulled straight out of <i>Birdemic: Shock and Terror</i> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/" class="paragraphLinks">that's an actual film, by the way</a>) and nobody would bat an eye. Yes, the voice acting is solid and the storyline isn't full of gaping holes, but even mentioning those aspects of <i>DOOM</i> is akin to congratulating Johnny Sins on his amazing performance as the pizza delivery guy. You already know that the goal of the game is to make demons explode, and waiting for the voice recordings to finish playing is either an annoyance or an opportunity to take a break for a minute or two, depending on the kind of player that you are.</p>

<p>The kind of gamer that you are will also determine the game's performance on your computer: The game's highest settings look absolutely stunning, but are also intensive enough that the game was at one time used to benchmark brand new graphics cards. All worry that the game would lose its charm with lower-resolution textures and such are baseless, however, as the world, the monsters, the blood, and the explosions still retain incredible fidelity even on ageing hardware. id Software are to be praised for the work they've done optimizing their id Tech 6 engine, bringing the experience to people who aren't willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for the privilege of being able to launch their videogames, let alone play them at high settings.</p>

<p>All in all, <i>DOOM</i> is a bit nostalgic. The gameplay and level design hark back to the shooter games of old, and certainly the people who remember those days best will be able to enjoy the nostalgia as well, thanks to the game's compatibility with older systems. Not so much a story-driven piece, the reason <i>DOOM</i> has been showered with praise is because it proves late 90s and early 2000s shooters aren't only glorified because of nostalgia, but rather because their gameplay truly was a spectacle. This 2016 masterpiece takes that spectacle and gives it a modern spin, and it is rightfully so that <i>DOOM</i> is called the best franchise reboot of all time, and perhaps even one of the best games of this decade.</p>

<p>Lettuce Play is a series of reviews that are late to the party. Because being a patient gamer pays off.</p>
