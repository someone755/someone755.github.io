<h1>Finally done?</h1>  
<p class="paragraph">Finally, this revision of the site redesign (let's call it 2.0) has been completed. Envisioned from the ground up, the new template boasts powerful multi-device support and stunningly simple site navigation.</p>
<div class="articleSeparator"></div>

<p>From this site's very beginning, I was using Github Pages to help me render exercises that we had done during my university's 'programming basics' class, which covered the basic characteristics of HTML and CSS, as well as a relatively lengthy introduction to Javascript. As future electrical engineers, this was a great stepping stone to C, which we are now using to program Arduino boards, but I digress. Ultimately, this class led to the creation of the <a href="../opL/sudoku.html" class="paragraphLinks">'ugly sudoku'</a>, a highly dysfunctional batch of Javascript-generated interactive tables and numbers that doesn't really surve a purpose beyond "just being there".</p>
<p>After a while, I started using the Github repository as a storage for the university's C/microcontroller lectures and lessons, and the notes have already garnered a positive response from some of my classmates, but the site had largely remained unchanged; crude HTML seemed to rule this unorganized waste.<br>Shortly thereafter, I did <i>some</i> experimentation with a two-column design and flexbox, but I eventually encountered errors when trying to display the new page. And I decided then that I <b>needed</b> something simple but functional, or risk looking like a fool with my bare HTML. So I went to the drawing board. Quite literally, in fact.</p>
<p>And now we're here. Of course, the page isn't like the drawing imagines it, but the result is aimed even more towards my main goals: A no-frills adapdable frame coupled with high-performing and low-bandwidth content. All this using only HTML and CSS, with a dash of Javascript.</p>
<p>From this point on, all I can say is, I hope you enjoy the site. No matter your level of expertise, you are free to help improve it on Github, fork it, or just report bugs and other strange phenomena and artifacts through the <a href="https://github.com/someone755/someone755.github.io/issues/new" class="paragraphLinks">bug tracker</a>. I wish you all the best, and I hope to see you again soon.</p>
