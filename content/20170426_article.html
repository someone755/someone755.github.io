<h1>Finally done?</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Finally, this revision of the site redesign (let's call it 2.0) has been completed. Envisioned from the ground up, the new template boasts powerful multi-device support and stunningly simple site navigation.</p>
<div class="articleSeparator"></div>

<p>From this site's very beginning, I was using Github Pages to render exercises that we had done during my university's "programming basics" class, which covered the basic characteristics of HTML and CSS, as well as a relatively lengthy introduction to Javascript. As future electrical engineers, this was a great stepping stone to C, which we are now using to program Arduino boards, but I digress. Ultimately, this class led to the creation of the <a href="../opL/sudoku.html" class="paragraphLinks">"ugly sudoku"</a>, a highly dysfunctional batch of Javascript-generated interactive tables and numbers that doesn't really serve a purpose beyond "just being there".</p>

<div class="imgDivRight"><a href="resContent/20170426_img01.png" target="_blank"><img class="imgRight" src="resContent/20170426_img01.png"></img></a><span class="imgDescribe">The mess that is the sudoku project.</span></div>

<p>After a while, I started using the Github repository as public storage for the university's C/microcontroller lectures and lessons, and the notes have already garnered a positive response from some of my classmates, but the site had largely remained unchanged; crude HTML seemed to rule this unorganized waste.</p>

<div class="imgDivLeft"><a href="resContent/20170426_img02.png" target="_blank"><img class="imgLeft" src="resContent/20170426_img02.png"></img></a><span class="imgDescribe">The first version of the site was crude, to put it lightly.</span></div>

<p>Shortly thereafter, I did <i>some</i> experimentation with a two-column design and flexbox, but I eventually encountered errors when trying to adapt the new page to multiple devices. And I decided then that I <b>needed</b> something simple but functional, or risk looking like a fool with my bare HTML. So I went to the drawing board. Quite literally, in fact.</p>

<div class="imgDivCenter"><a href="resContent/20170426_img03.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="imgCenter" src="resContent/20170426_img03.jpg" style="max-width:200px"></img></a><span class="imgDescribe">A sketch of what I thought the site would look like.</span></div>

<p>And now we're here. Of course, the page isn't like the drawing imagines it, but the result is aimed even more towards my original goals: A no-frills adaptable frame coupled with high-performing and low-bandwidth content. All this using only HTML and CSS, with a dash of Javascript.</p>

<p>From this point on, all I can say is, I hope you enjoy the site. No matter your level of expertise, you are free to help improve it on Github, fork it, or just report bugs and other strange phenomena and artifacts through the <a href="https://github.com/someone755/someone755.github.io/issues/new" class="paragraphLinks">bug tracker</a>. I wish you all the best, and I hope to see you again soon.</p>
