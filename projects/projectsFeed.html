<h2>University</h2><p>My top priority without a doubt. As of now, the only instance of this online is my <a href="https://github.com/someone755/uni" class="paragraphLinks">uni repo</a> (in Slovene), which houses lessons from programming classes I'm taking (except for the <a href="opL/sudoku.html" class="paragraphLinks">"ugly sudoku"</a>), along with some university-related code developed in my free time, such as the platform-agnostic and learner-friendly <a href="https://github.com/someone755/tomfoolery/tree/cdraw" class="paragraphLinks">cdraw libraries</a>, used for drawing bitmap files with C.
</p>
<h2>Photography</h2><p>As a lover of the art of photography, I've taken up the hobby myself as well. I publish some of my shots <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/148092883@N02/" class="paragraphLinks">on Flickr</a>.

<h2>kernel12</h2><p>One of my most used projects, the kernel12 project was originally an adventure into the realms of custom Android kernels. Officially, it supports Sony's 2014 Z3 Compact smartphone, running official CyanogenMod 12 and 12.1 builds based on Android 5.0 and 5.1, respectively. The project later branched out to also support Sony's official Android 5.1 and 6.0 releases, as well as their 'Concept for Android' project running on top of Android 6.0.<br>
  The original XDA Forums thread, focusing on cm-12.1, can be found <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/orig-development/cm12-kernel12-22-2-2015-t3037663" class="paragraphLinks">here</a>, while the parts of the project supporting official Sony firmware and Concept firmware, dubbed kernel12s and kernel12c, respectively, are detailed in a <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/kernel-sernel12s-25-7-2016-t3425380" class="paragraphLinks">separate thread</a> on the XDA Forums.

<h2>kerneller</h2><p>Developed as part of the kernel12 project, kerneller is a homebrew replacement for solutions such as AnyKernel, in that it is capable of building boot images from a precompiled kernel, ramdisk, and device tree binary on the fly while being flashed through an Android recovery. The one thing setting it apart from similar implementations is the ability to let the user choose—at installation time—whether they want SELinux enabled or disabled.
