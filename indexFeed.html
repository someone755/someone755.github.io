<h1>Lettuce Play: Firewatch</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Imagine with me the summer of 1989 in Wyoming. You have a job as a fire lookout. You're walking through the woods and enjoying the scenery when suddenly you hear a speaker crackling. It's your walkie-talkie buzzing with the voice of your supervisor, Delilah, as she wants to talk. And you have the choice to either ignore her or respond and risk having to explain your wife's dementia for the fifth or sixth time.</p>

<h1>This is my website.</h1>
<p class="paragraph">You've reached the end of this site. And whether you're lost or a brave explorer, you are welcome. This site was made to showcase some of my online work and has so far evolved from basic HTML into a simple-but-beautiful webpage. And you're more than welcome to track its (future?) progress, <a href="https://github.com/someone755/someone755.github.io/commits/master" class="paragraphLinks">here</a>!</p>
