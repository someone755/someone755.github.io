<h1>Lettuce Play: Shadow of Mordor</h1>
<p class="postData">July 26th, 2017 | Read time: 4 minutes</p>
<p class="paragraph">You're playing a good old Assassin's Creed game, climbing along the rooftops of late 15th century Venice, fighting Italian soldiers and riding your horse, when suddenly you realize that something is off. Instead of Venice, it's Mordor, straight from Tolkien's books, Italian men are replaced with Orcs, and your horse is actually a monstrous giant. Oh, and the game is actually <i>fun</i>.</p>
<p>Lettuce Play is an ongoing series of reviews-slash-opinions that are late to the party. And that's okay, because neither enjoyment nor its analysis should be rushed out for the sake of driving more traffic to your website.</p>

<h1>Lettuce Play: Firewatch</h1>
<p class="postData">July 8th, 2017 | Reading time: 4 minutes</p>
<p class="paragraph">Imagine with me the summer of 1989 in Wyoming. You have a job as a fire lookout. You're walking through the woods and enjoying the scenery when suddenly you hear a speaker crackling. It's your walkie-talkie buzzing with the voice of your supervisor, Delilah, as she wants to talk. And you have the choice to either ignore her or respond and risk having to explain your wife's dementia for the fifth or sixth time.</p>
